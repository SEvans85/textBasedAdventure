# What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
# What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?
# In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so itâ€™s not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.
# What might you consider to be a good outcome for your project? A better outcome? The best outcome?
